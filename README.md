# Python-Scrape
An attempt to use some of the Python I've been learning recently to scrape some data for a Qlik Demo app. The app is meant to chart inventory for a car dealership.

Partner programmed with Austin Spivey to help me fill in some gaps!

Later used DB Browser for SQL Lite to read in and check the file created with the Python script before bringing it into Qlik.
